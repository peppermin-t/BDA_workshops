**Workshop 1: Introduction to INLA**

**Note**: Before starting this practical, you are advised to spend some
time looking at the INLA examples we have discussed during Lecture 2
(available in lecture-2.Rmd on Learn). If you already looked at these,
then feel free to go directly to question 1. The code below loads INLA.

```{r}
library(INLA)

#If it loaded correctly, you should see this in the output:
#Loading required package: Matrix
#Loading required package: sp
#This is INLA_23.09.09 built 2023-10-16 17:29:11 UTC.
# - See www.r-inla.org/contact-us for how to get help.

#Installation instructions for various operating systems are explained on  https://www.r-inla.org/download-install
#The following code does the full installation. You can try it if INLA has not been installed.
#First installing some of the dependencies (especially on Windows) 
#Note that the installation may stop several times, and a pop-up window could appear, where you need to select installation from source or binary (usually binary is ok).

#### **1. Simple linear regression with robustification**

#### **Winning Olympic Men's Long Jump Distances (adapted from Witmer, 2017)**

**The data are the winning men's long jump distances (m) from 1900
through 2008. You will fit a linear regression of the distances as a
function of Olympic year:** $$\begin{aligned}
Jump & = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mbox{Year} + \epsilon\end{aligned}$$
**three different ways: standard frequentist approach, a Bayesian
approach assuming normal errors (using INLA), and a Bayesian approach
assuming a** $t$ **distribution for errors (using INLA).**

**Run the following commands in `R` to begin (this will install and load
the package Stat2Data and load the Long Jump dataset).**

```{r}
library(Stat2Data)
#If not available, run this first:
#install.packages("Stat2Data")

data("LongJumpOlympics")   #Makes the dataset available in this R session
Jump <- LongJumpOlympics$Gold
Year <- LongJumpOlympics$Year
#You can get more info about the dataset by the command
#help(topic="LongJumpOlympics",package="Stat2Data")
```

**1.1. Fit a simple linear regression on Jump against Year using the lm
function, and make a plot of the data with the fitted line overlaid
using the abline function.**

**1.2. Center the data, and carry out a Bayesian linear regression
analysis using `INLA`. As in the frequentist case assume** $\epsilon$
$\sim$ Normal(0, $\sigma^2$). Use the following priors for the three
parameters: $$\begin{aligned}
\beta_0, \beta_1 & \sim & \mbox{Normal} \left ( \mu_0=0, \tau_0=0.01 \right ) \\
\tau & \sim & \mbox{Gamma} \left ( a=0.1, b=0.1 \right )
\end{aligned}$$

**1.3. Compute the summary statistics and plot the densities for the
model parameters** $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\sigma$.

**1.4. Using a Bayesian Linear Model fitted with INLA with the same
priors as in (ii), plot the posterior predictive density of the long
jump distance in 2021 (hopefully the Summer Olympics will happen this
year). Compute the expectation and state 95% Bayesian credible intervals
for the long jump distance in 2021.**

**Hint: you can ensure that INLA computes the posterior predictive
distribution at time 2021 by including 2021 in your Year variable, while
setting the corresponding component in the Jump variable as NA.**

**1.5. Using INLA, compute the posterior predictive probability that the
winning jump in 1968 will be exceeded during the Olympics by 2028,
assuming that Olympics will be held in 2021, 2024 and 2028. Hint: you
can compute this by sampling from the posterior predictive.**

**1.6. *Robustifying the regression.* As was noted in Lecture 2, the
effects of extreme observations or "outliers" on regressing results can
be diminished by using a** $t$ **distribution for the observations. For
simplicity, first assume a** $t$ **distribution with 3 degrees of
freedom for the distribution of errors. Revise the INLA model code from
1.2-1.3 accordingly (continuing to work with the centered covariates)
and re-run.**

**1.7. In the robust regression INLA example in the previous question
(vi), set a set a pc.dof(15,0.5) prior on the degrees of freedom
parameter** $\nu$ **instead of fixing it at 3 (see
<https://github.com/grantbrown/inla/blob/master/r-inla.org/doc/prior/pc.dof.pdf>).
Plot the posterior distribution of** $\nu$**.**

**1.8. Compare the linear regression model from part 1.2 with the robust
linear regression models from parts 1.6 and 1.7 in terms of marginal
likelihood, Negative Sum Log CPO values, and DIC critera. Which one
seems to be the best fit on the data according to these criteria?**

#### 2. Predicting house prices

![](images/taipei.jpg)

**In this problem, we are going to model house prices per unit area in a
dataset containing 414 recent transactions in Taipei.**

**The available covariates are i) transaction date (this is stored as a
real number between 2012 and 2014, i.e. 2013.5 corresponds to 1 July,
2013) ii) house age iii) distance from nearest MRT (metro) station in
meters iv) number of convenience stores within walking distance v)
latitude vi) longitude The response variable is the house price of unit
area.**

**The goal is to use INLA to fit several different regression models to
this dataset. First, we will load ILNA and the dataset (Real_estate.csv,
available on Learn).**

```{r}
#We load the Taipei house price dataset
house=read.csv("Real_estate.csv")
head(house)
```

**2.1. Start by centering and scaling all of the covariates (but keep
the response unchanged). Fit a standard linear regression model (lm)
with response as the logarithm of house price per unit area, using all
of the 6 covariates. Describe the quality of the fit, and state summary
statistics and the residual standard error.**

**2.2. Fit the same linear regression model as in 4.1, but now using
INLA. Set a Gamma (0.1,0.1) prior for the precision, and Gaussian priors
with mean zero and variance** $1000000$ **for all of the regression
coefficients (including the intercept). Print out the summary
statistics. Compute the posterior mean of the variance parameter**
$\sigma^2$**. Plot the posterior density for the variance parameter**
$\sigma^2$**. Compute the negative sum log CPO (NSLCPO) values for this
model (smaller values indicate better fit). Compute the standard
deviation of the mean residuals (i.e. the differences between the
posterior mean of the fitted values, and the true response variable).
Discuss the results.**

**2.3. Compute the studentized residuals for the Bayesian regression
model from part b). Perform a simple Q-Q plot on the studentized
residuals. Plot the studentized residuals versus their index, and also
plot the studentized residuals against the posterior mean of the fitted
value (see Lecture 2). Discuss the results.**

**2.4. Fit a robust linear regression model in the same settings as in
2.2. Set a Gamma (0.1,0.1) prior for the precision, and Gaussian priors
with mean zero and variance** $1000000$ **for all of the regression
coefficients (including the intercept). Print out the summary
statistics. Plot the posterior distribution of the degrees of freedom
parameter and the variance parameter** $\sigma^2$**. Compute the
negative sum log CPO (NSLCPO) values for this model (smaller values
indicate better fit). Compute the standard deviation of the mean
residuals. Discuss the results.**

**2.5. Modify the regression models of 2.2 and 2.4 by adding interaction
terms (such as the regression** $\texttt{y~x1+x2+I(x1*x2)}$ **will
create an additional covariate** $\texttt{x1*x2}$**). Find a model that
improves upon the previous models in terms of accuracy (i.e. the mean
residuals have smaller standard deviation). Print out the summary
statistics, compute NSLCPO and DIC, and the standard deviation of the
mean residuals. Discuss the results.**

**2.6. Using the model of part 4.2, compute and plot the posterior
predictive density of the average per unit area house price among all of
the houses in the dataset (414 in total) at transaction dates 2014.0,
2015.0 and 2016.0 (these correspond to 1 January). Compute the posterior
means for all 3 cases. You can assume that the covariates "distance from
nearest MRT", "number of convenience stores", "latitude", and
"longitude" stay the same, but the age covariate has to be updated
according to the transaction date.**

#### 3. Predicting soccer scores by Poisson regression

#### Adapted from "Modeling outcomes of soccer matches" by Tsokos et al.

**In this question, we are going to use a simple Poisson regression
model for modelling soccer scores. We will be working with the Premier
League 2019-2020 scores, that are available at
<https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php>. Suppose that there are**
$G$ **games in total, ordered in time.**

**We model the number of goals for the home team and the away team at
the end of game** $g$ **by two independent Poisson random variables,**
$$S_g^{H}\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{g}^{H}), \quad S_g^{A}\sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{g}^{A}),$$**where**
$S_g^{H}$ **denotes the number of goals of the home team at game**
$g$**, and** $S_g^{A}$ **denotes the number of goals of the away team at
game** $g$**.**

**These are assumed to be Poisson distributed with rates**
$\lambda_{g}^{H}$ **and** $\lambda_{g}^{A}$**.**

**These rates are related to linear predictors by the** $\log$ **link
function, i.e.** $\eta_{g}^{H}=\log(\lambda_{g}^{H})$ **and**
$\eta_{g}^{A}=\log(\lambda_{g}^{A})$**.**

**The linear predictors themselves are going to be modeled as a
combination of three terms: attacking strength, defending ability, and
whether the team is playing at home, or away. For each team, we denote
their attacking strength parameter by** $a_{team}$**, their defending
strength parameter by** $d_{team}$**, and the effect of playing at home
as** $h$ **(this effect is assumed to be the same for each team in the
first instance, but you could also try to make it team specific**
$h_{team}$**). This quantifies the effect of playing at home on the
linear predictor of the number of goals, expected to be positive.**

**Our model for the linear predictors (**$\eta_g^{H}$ **is for the goals
scored by the home team, and is** $\eta_g^{A}$ **is for the away team)
is the following:**

$$\begin{align}
\eta_{g}^{H}&= \beta_0+a_{home.team}+d_{away.team}+h\\
\eta_{g}^{A}&= \beta_0+a_{away.team}+d_{home.team}
\end{align}$$

**Here** $\beta_0$ **is the intercept. In order to avoid model
identifiability issues (for example, if we increase** $a$ **by a certain
amount for each team, and decrease** $d$ **by the same amount, nothing
changes), the convention is to set the attacking and defending strength
parameter** $a_{team}$ **and** $d_{team}$ **equal to 0 for one of the
teams (so they are no longer part of the model). This is handled
automatically by R if you use categorical variables for this.**

**Now we are going to load our dataset, implement this model in INLA,
and then use our model for computing the posterior probability
distribution of who will be the champion of the league after each round
of games.**

**Note that this is a very basic model that could be significantly
improved by including more covariates.**

**The code below loads the data.**

```{r}
#We load the Premier League scores dataset of season 2019/2020 
full.data=read.csv("premier_league_2019_20.csv")

head(full.data)

#The code below displays the info file about the dataset from football_data_notes.txt
#fname <- 'football_data_notes.txt'
#s=readChar(fname, file.info(fname)$size)
#cat(s)
```

**FTHG means full time home goals, and FTAG means full time away
goals.**

**There are 20 teams in the Premier League (you can see the list below
for the season 2019-2020).**

**Every team in the league plays twice against each other, so in total,
there are 20\*19=380 games per season.**

**The Premier League teams in 2019/20:**

**Arsenal\
Aston Villa\
Bournemouth\
Brighton & Hove Albion\
Burnley\
Chelsea\
Crystal Palace\
Everton\
Leicester City\
Liverpool  Manchester City\
Manchester United\
Newcastle United\
Norwich City\*\
Sheffield United\*\
Southampton\
Tottenham Hotspur\
Watford\
West Ham United\
Wolverhampton Wanderers**

**\* are newly promoted teams**

**3.1. Implement the Poisson regression model described above in INLA on
this dataset, using the default priors.** **Print out the summary
statistics for the model, and discuss the results.**

**Hint: you need to store the number of goals scored by the home and
away teams in a single response vector, y. For example, you can let**
$y_1,\ldots,y_G$ **correspond to the goals by the home teams in games**
$1,\ldots,G$**, and** $y_{G+1},\ldots, y_{2G}$ **correspond to the goals
by the away teams in games** $1,\ldots, G$**.\
The other covariates should also be adjusted accordingly.**\
**Using factors (i.e. categorical variables) is recommended.\
Combining two lists of factors is possible by turning them into strings
using** $\texttt{as.character}$**, then combining them, and finally
turning them back to factors by** $\texttt{as.factor}$**.\
The outcome variables** $y_{1},\ldots, y_{2G}$ **contain the number of
goals team A scores against another team B (A and B depends on index**
$i$ **of** $y_i$**).\
The rate** $\lambda_i$ **for this variable** $y_i$ **in our Poisson
model, and the corresponding linear predictor** $\eta_i$**, are
controlled by the attacking strength team** $A$**, the defending
strength of team** $B$**, and whether team** $A$ **is the home team, or
not. This model can be described by three categorical variables**
$\texttt{attack}$**,** $\texttt{defense}$ **and** $\texttt{home}$**,
with INLA formula of the form**
$$\texttt{y}\sim \texttt{attack+defense+home},$$**provided that we
encode the names of the teams A, B and whether team A is the home team
or not as 3 columns in a dataframe (as factors).**

**3.2. The games in the Premier League happen by rounds (typically
lasting one week), where each team plays with another one. There are 20
teams, so 10 games per round.**\
**Games 10(i-1) +1,..., 10 i in the dataset correspond to round i (there
are some slight discrepancies in times, but we will ignore them here for
simplicity).\
At the end of each game, the winner gets 3 points, the loser gets 0, and
if its a draw, both teams receive 1 points. Using our Poisson regression
model, compute the posterior probability of Liverpool winning the league
(i.e. having the most points at the end of all games) at the end of each
round for rounds 5, 10,15,20,25,30 and 35. Plot the result.\
[Hint: you can set the number of goals in the games played after row i
as NA in the dataset, and then call INLA. The Predictor variables in the
output of `inla.posterior.sample` contain samples of the linear
predictors from the posterior, including those for the remaining games.
You are recommended to write a separate function computing the points
(i.e. league table) from the scores of all games.]**
